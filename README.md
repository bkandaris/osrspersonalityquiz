# JavaScript Quiz Application

### `Why did I build this project?`

Many people enjoy playing OSRS and even more enjoy taking personality quizzes! This was a fun way to use my skills as a web developer to provide value to myself and others.

### `What did I learn?`

There was a lot of logic that went into creating this quiz. Creating the questions and traits while figuring out how to create an end result was fun to solve. This gave me some more practice using redux with hooks which is an enjoyable and simple way to handle global state.
